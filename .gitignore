1. **Create Virtual Environment**
```bash
# Create virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv

# Activate virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate  # On Unix/macOS
```

2. **Install Dependencies**
```bash
# Install required packages
python3 -m pip install selenium webdriver-manager python-dotenv
```

3. **Environment Variables**
Create a `.env` file in the project root:
```bash
ZOHO_EMAIL=your.email@zoho.com
ZOHO_APP_PASSWORD=your_app_specific_password
```

## Usage

1. **Activate Virtual Environment** (if not already activated)
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

2. **Usage**
```bash
# Scrape new jobs (will delete old email files first)
make scrape

# Send emails from most recent file
make send

# Send a test email to yourself
make test-email
```

## Features

- Visual scraping with Chrome browser
- Filters for "No budget (actors*actresses and speakers)" jobs
- Email capability with Zoho SMTP
- Detailed logging of found jobs

## Project Structure

- `main.py` - Main script that orchestrates the scraping process
- `job_scraper.py` - Contains the job scraping logic
- `driver_manager.py` - Manages the Chrome WebDriver
- `config.py` - Configuration settings

## Common Issues & Solutions

1. **Selenium/Chrome Issues**
   - Make sure Chrome is installed
   - The script uses ChromeDriver which is automatically managed

2. **Email Setup**
   - Zoho requires an App-Specific Password
   - Generate one at: Zoho Mail → Settings → Security → App Passwords

3. **Package Installation Issues**
   - Always use the virtual environment
   - If pip gives errors, try `python3 -m pip install --ignore-installed`

## Deployment Options

1. **Local Scheduled Task**
   - Use cron (Unix/macOS) to run periodically
   ```bash
   # Example: Run every day at 9 AM
   0 9 * * * cd /path/to/crew-united-scraper && source venv/bin/activate && python3 main.py
   ```

2. **Cloud Deployment**
   - Consider using GitHub Actions for scheduled runs
   - Or deploy to a small VPS/cloud instance

## Maintenance

- Keep Chrome and packages updated
- Monitor for changes in Crew United's website structure
- Regularly check your Zoho email settings
